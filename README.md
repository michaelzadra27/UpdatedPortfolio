# <Portfolio Project>
## This website is used to display my portfolio of projects that I will be building throught the course. It will eventually link to all the cool applications that I've made over the course of the project.

The whole point here was to have a starter website to host my portfolio. Through the course of building it, I became muc more familiar with HTML and CSS. I spent easily over 20 hours coding this site, scrapped a few revisions, and almost broke a few keys but it came together well. There are a few things that need to be worked on still but its a good start.
